All files needed for Pico Ducky and in the zip folder. I took all the work out of it so all you Have to do is download the zip file and extract. Once extracted, copy all and place inside on the root.
I have taken the liberty of populating the payload file with the infamous rick roll to prank your friends. If you do not use chrome, feel free to change it to the browser of your choice.

Enjoy!!
