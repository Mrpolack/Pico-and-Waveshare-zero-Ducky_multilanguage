This is a fork of orignal work of xHackTechx, I just added the support files to change the keyboard input language/different layout
# Pico-Ducky
Have your Pico Pi or Waveshare RP2040 Zero ducky up and running in two minutes.
* Go to the following link, in the search bar type the name of your device https://circuitpython.org/downloads
* click on your device
* click the download .UF2 Now button
* Drag and drop the file from your downloads to the root
* It will disconnect and reconnect as Circuitpy
* All files needed for Pico Ducky and in the "rp2040_multilanguage" folder. I took all the work out of it so all you Have to do is download the zip file and extract. Once extracted, copy all and place inside on the root.
The default payload is just a test for some special chars, feel free to edit as you like

Enjoy!! (@xHackTechx thanks again for the original project)
